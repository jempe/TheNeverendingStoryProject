Once upon a time in a galaxy far away on a vibrant, jungle-covered moon called Xylos, lived a young inventor named Zia. Unlike the other Xylosains content with tending to their bioluminescent flora, Zia dreamt of the stars. Her workshop, a chaotic explosion of wires, gears, and salvaged spaceship parts, overflowed with half-finished contraptions that hummed with a life of their own. One scorching afternoon, while fiddling with a contraption of salvaged antennae and glowing crystals, Zia intercepted a faint distress signal. It crackled with urgency, a plea for help from a ship caught in a meteor shower far beyond Xylos' atmosphere. The message originated from a legendary vessel, the Stardust, piloted by the famed explorer, Captain Nova. Inspiration surged through Zia. This was her chance, not just to help, but to prove her inventions weren't just a jumble of spare parts. With a determined glint in her eye, Zia cobbled together her most ambitious project yet - a ramshackle spaceship cobbled from spare parts, held together by hope and her boundless ingenuity.
